        <p>In fact, they do. Like most hounds, Basenjis are very vocal. How(l)ever, unlike with most dogs, one can hardly call it a bark. The unique noise they make can be best described as a yodel. </p>
        <p>These yodles have mesmerised people even in ancient Egypt, where the breed origitanes from. It may very vell be considered a form of art. Just listen to these <a href="https://youtu.be/HNqXYSeIrOY">majestic melodies</a></p>

        <p>Clever and endearing, these dogs are good companions for the person or family who can stay a step ahead of them. They can adapt to apartment living, and even novice pet parents will find these pups to be great first-timer dogs. Just make sure you can provide enough exercise to meet their high energy levels. Youâ€™ll need to commit to plenty of walks and playtime.Basenji dogs posess wonderful traits:</p>
<ul>
<li>alert</li>
<li>curious</li>
<li>and reserved with strangers</li>
</ul>
<p>Basenjis often stand on their hind legs, somewhat like a meerkat, by themselves or leaning on something; this behavior is often observed when the dog is curious about something. They also come in three colors:</p>
<ol>
<li>red/white</li>
<li>black/white</li>
<li>tricolor</li>
</ol>
